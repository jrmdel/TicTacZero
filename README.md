# TicTacZero

This project aims to create a advanced version of the reknown Tic Tac Toe with two AIs fighting :
- An alpha-beta algorithm
- An implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm developed by DeepMind

To do so, I intend to use PyQt5 for the GUI, and TensorFlow for the neural network behind AlphaZero

## Prerequisites

Python3 and pip3 must be installed on your computer.

PyQt5 is needed. Follow these steps to install it on a Linux environment :

```
python3 -m pip install pyqt5==5.14
sudo apt-get install pyqt5-dev-tools
sudo apt-get install qttools5-dev-tools -y
```
